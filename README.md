# Competitive-Analysis
2023 Financial benchmarking Report: Xiaomi &amp; Samsung

This project was by far the most challenging project for me.
Over 12hrs of continuous research, planning and analysis in an attempt to build a proper competitive analysis report.
This was an attempt to turn my authentic idea into something real. No recommendation, no inspiration, nothing. Purely based on my own idea, path, narration and the was I wanted to storytell a financial competitive analysis of two of the biggest tech giants. 
Built a dataset right from scratch, manually calculated all the ratios, cleaned the data, transformed it and comprehensively designed the Power BI report to present the finfings as clearly as possible.

 Would  recommend using Power Bi app or service to open the file.
